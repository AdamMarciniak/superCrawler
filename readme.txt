This project aims to bring food nutritional data together with local prices.
Phase 1 is to write a web scraper to access the grocery store website and download all the data it needs.
Phase 2 is to build a database (sql?) to organize the data.
Phase 3 in tandem with phase 2 is to build a website to access the data with a beautiful interface.
Phase 4 Crack open a cold one with the boys.*

* phase 4 actually occurs before, during and after each phase multiple times. This delays all other phases but makes the engineer
feel good.
